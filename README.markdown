# A Technical Documentation Page
Technical documentation refers to any document that explains the use, functionality, creation, or architecture of a product. Think of it as a nuts-and-bolts “how to” guide for your users, new hires, administrators, and anyone else who needs to know how your product works.

Attached project is about a sample Technical Documentation Page on Looping Techniques in C.
